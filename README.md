# ffbeEquip-Flutter

This project is inspired by [Lyrgard][1], who created and maintains [ffbeEquip][2]. The goal is to create a hybrid application in Flutter which could recreate the same functionalities without the need for an internet connection. Sweet!

Please note that this project is **far** from completion. This is a monumental task, and I only have so much free time.
